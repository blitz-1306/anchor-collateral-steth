# stETH as Anchor collateral

This repo contains Ethereum contracts for integrating stETH as a collateral into the
[Anchor protocol]. Currently it assumes the deployed [Wormhole bridge] between Ethereum
and Terra networks.

The initial specification: [docs/spec.md](./docs/spec.md).

The code is an early draft, only use it as a hint of what's to expect.
